# Basic Arithmetic Operations in Python

This Python script demonstrates simple arithmetic operations on two variables: addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

## Variables
- `number1` — assigned the value 10
- `number2` — assigned the value 5

## Operations
- Calculates the **sum** of `number1` and `number2`
- Calculates the **difference** between `number1` and `number2`
- Calculates the **product** of `number1` and `number2`

## Output
The script prints the results of the arithmetic operations to the terminal:


## How to Run
1. Save the script as `basic_operations.py`.
2. Run the script using Python:

          python3 basic_operations.py
